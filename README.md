# NAO Planning Challenge

### Group: Silk Sonic
### Members: Alessandro CalÃ²

This is a study project for the Fundamentals of AI and Knowledge Representation course. The goal is to make a simulated NAO robot dance to a choreography that is generated by an algorithm of our creation.

## Files
moves      -> directory that contains all of the moves, custom and default <br>
main.py    -> main python file to run <br>
search.py  -> python file containing the algorithm

## Setting up the environment
This python project needs some additional libraries in order to work: <br>
time, os, pygame, naoqi <br>
All of these, except for naoqi, are easily obtainable trough the command:

> pip install *name*

To use naoqi, follow this [guide](http://doc.aldebaran.com/2-5/dev/community_software.html#retrieving-software)



## Usage
- Open Choreographe
- In the main.py file, go to line 76 (the last one), where the main() function is called, change the port to match the one in Choreographe
- Run the main.py file and watch NAO dance :)
